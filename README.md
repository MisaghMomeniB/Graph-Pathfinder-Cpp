# Graph-Pathfinder-Cpp
GraphPathfinder is a C++ project implementing two popular shortest-path algorithms: Dijkstra and A*. This project provides a detailed implementation of these algorithms for finding the shortest path in weighted, undirected graphs. It also includes an A* implementation that uses a heuristic based on Euclidean distance to optimize the search.
